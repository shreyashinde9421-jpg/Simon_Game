# Simon Game 🎮

## Description
This is a web-based implementation of the classic **Simon Game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The game helps improve memory and concentration by challenging users to remember and repeat color sequences.

## Technologies Used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

## Features
- Random color sequence generation  
- Level-based gameplay  
- User input validation  
- Visual effects and animations  
- Game over and restart functionality  

## How to Play
1. Press any key / click Start to begin the game.  
2. Watch the color sequence shown by the game.  
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the color buttons.  
4. Each correct sequence increases the level.  
5. A wrong input ends the game.

## Game Logic
- The game generates a random color sequence and stores it in an array.  
- User inputs are compared with the game sequence.  
- If the sequence matches, the game proceeds to the next level; otherwise, the game resets.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` – Game layout  
- `style.css` – Styling and animations  
- `app.js` – Game logic  

## Future Enhancements
- High score tracking using localStorage    

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of DOM manipulation  
- Use of event listeners in JavaScript  
- Improved logic-building skills  
- Experience in building interactive web applications
